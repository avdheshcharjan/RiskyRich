CI policies typically cover conditions like cancer, heart attack, and stroke - the big stuff that can derail your finances\n3. While MediShield helps with hospitalization, CI coverage gives you a lump sum to handle non-medical costs like time off work, lifestyle adjustments, or alternative treatments\n\nLIA recommends about 4√ó your annual income in CI coverage. For you, that's around $240k protection. Without it, you're financially vulnerable if serious illness strikes."

Let's find something that fits your budget.\n\nHere's the thing - term life insurance is surprisingly affordable for the protection it offers. For example, a healthy 30-year-old might pay less than $1 a day for $500k of term coverage. That's less than your daily coffee!\n\nAnd you don't have to close your entire protection gap at once. Start with what you can afford now, maybe prioritizing critical illness since you have zero coverage there, and add more as your income increases.\n\nSinglife offers flexible plans that can be tailored to your budget constraints while still providing meaningful protection.

Their CI plan covers over 130 conditions, including early and intermediate stages of critical illnesses, which means you get protection even before an illness becomes severe.\n\nBoth plans have straightforward application processes and competitive premiums.
