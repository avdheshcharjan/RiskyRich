## How Singlife Products Address Protection Gaps

### For Life Insurance Gaps
1. **Term Life Plan**: Ideal for closing large protection gaps (e.g., 9-10× income requirement) at affordable rates
   $CoverageGap_{Life} = (9 \times AnnualIncome) - ExistingCoverage$
   $TermLifeCoverage \geq CoverageGap_{Life}$
2. **Benefit Right-sizing**: Can tailor exact coverage amount to close specific gap

### For Critical Illness Gaps
1. **Multipay CI Plan**: Provides the recommended 4× income coverage for critical illness
   $CoverageGap_{CI} = (4 \times AnnualIncome) - ExistingCICoverage$
   $MultipayCICoverage \geq CoverageGap_{CI}$
2. **Early Stage Coverage**: Added protection that pays out before condition becomes advanced
3. **Multiple Claim Feature**: Unlike traditional CI plans, allows multiple claims for different conditions

## Recommending the Right Product

When recommending products, consider:
1. **Size of Gap**: Larger gaps may require term insurance for affordability
   $CoveragePriority = \begin{cases}
   \text{Term Life}, & \text{if } Gap_{Life} > \$500,000 \\
   \text{CI Cover}, & \text{if } Gap_{CI} = 100\% \\
   \text{Integrated Solution}, & \text{if multiple moderate gaps}
   \end{cases}$
2. **Life Stage**: Young families need more death coverage; older individuals need more CI/health coverage
3. **Budget Constraints**: Start with most critical gaps if budget is limited
   $OptimalAllocation = \max(\frac{Coverage}{Premium})$
4. **Health Conditions**: Pre-existing conditions may impact eligibility
5. **Long-term Plans**: Consider whether needs will change (e.g., more children planned)

## Premium Estimates

While exact premiums vary based on age, health, and coverage amount, here are general guidelines:
- **Term Life**: 30-year-old might pay $300-$500 annually for $500,000 coverage
  $EstimatedPremium_{Term} \approx \$0.60 - \$1.00 \text{ per } \$1,000 \text{ coverage annually}$
- **Critical Illness**: 30-year-old might pay $500-$800 annually for $200,000 coverage
  $EstimatedPremium_{CI} \approx \$2.50 - \$4.00 \text{ per } \$1,000 \text{ coverage annually}$
- **Integrated Solutions**: May offer 5-15% savings compared to purchasing separate policies
  $IntegratedPremium = (Premium_{Term} + Premium_{CI}) \times (0.85 - 0.95)$

## Coverage Optimization Formula

For optimal coverage within budget constraints:
$MaximizeProtection = \max(\sum_{i=1}^{n} Coverage_i)$
$Subject To: \sum_{i=1}^{n} Premium_i \leq Budget$

## Value Calculation

To calculate the value of insurance products:
$ValueRatio = \frac{Coverage}{Premium}$
$CoverageScore = \frac{Coverage_{Selected}}{Coverage_{Recommended}} \times 100\%$
